        <h2>Why build a wood sword?</h2> 
        <p>Woodworking is a very nuanced endeavor. Very minor differences in the desired outcome can mean very different means of obtaining such an outcome. And, as with anything, practice makes perfect. So when asked why would you make a wood sword, the answer of course is practice. Practicing the methods to produce a desired design will help in adding a little "razzle dazzle" to an otherwise boring nightstand, table, bookshelf, or whatever more practice project you are undertaking. In the same way that simply making small boxes (which are neat but have limited use) is a great way to practice joinery for future, more useful projects, so it is that making a wood sword will help you with wood turning, intricate band saw or scroll saw cutting, router table use, and the dreaded sanding and finishing. Alternatively, when asked why make a wood sword, you may also simply reply, "why not?"</p>

        <h2>Steps of the Process</h2>
        <p>The following steps are not rules, and depending on the type and style of sword you choose, may need to change it up, add steps, or disregard steps. This guide will be building a long sword, but you may choose to make something else, which may involve other steps. This is designed to give you a starting point, and as you get comfortable, you can make something of your own.</p>

                <h4>The Blade</h4>
                <p>The first step in making a wood sword is to start with the blade. The blade will determine the size of the handle and cross-guard. To begin, decide what the length, width, and thickness of the blade will be, and then decide the length of handle. Once you have decided on these things, select a board appropriate to that size, and draw a line down the middle the length of the board. Make marks on how long the blade will be. Next, where the hilt of the sword will be (where the visible blade ends), make a mark approximately 3-4 inches past, to indicate where the sword blade will be inserted into the hilt (called the tang). Next, trace straight lines parallel to the center line on each side, to identify the thickest part of the width of the blade (near the hilt). Next, since swords come to a point, draw even curved lines to a point of your choosing down the blade, where you want the taper to begin. Look up images of swords that are similar in design to the one your planning, to get an idea of how you want the blade to look. Put simply, make an outline of the blade you want, and make sure you put a 3-4 inch tang at the base. The blade should be angle down to the tang, and be no wider than 3/4", as shown in the picture below.</p>
                <p>An optional step is to use a router table to make the "fuller", or the groove down the center of the blade. Use your router table and cut the groove to the desired length based on your design. Do this before you cut the outline out, so the groove will be down the center of the blade. Doing this after the blade is cut out will be significantly harder.</p>
                <p>Once you have the outline, use a bandsaw, scroll saw, or jigsaw (jigsaw will be hard to make straight cuts, but its doable) to cut the rough outline out (you can use a sander to make fine corrections, just make sure you don't cut too much off. Error on not cutting enough as opposed to cutting on the inside of your outline. Next you'll want to create the edge of the blade. Easiest way to do this is the router table, with a angled bit. Run the blade along the bit, making sure not to take too much material off at a time to avoid problems. Make sure to leave an inch or two at the bottom of the blade square. This is common on swords, looks good, and will help your cross-guard fit flush without gaps. See the picture for a reference.</p>

                <h4>The Cross-Guard</h4>
                <p>The cross-guard is the horizontal piece of the sword that protects the handle, and your hands. To make this piece, you will need to cut out 3 rectangles of equal size, larger than your desired cross-guard design. Trace your design on all three boards. Now measure the thickness of your blade. Select one board to be the same thickness as your blade. This piece is what the blade will slide into. The other 2 pieces should be cut thinner, so as to not make the whole project too thick.</p>
                <p>Take the 2 thinner pieces you just made, and cut out the outline like you did with the blade. Take the remaining board, and put your blade over top where you want the blade to sit once its finished. Trace where the blade sits. Next, you will cut out the pieces, which will split it into 2 separate pieces. You should have 4 total pieces, 2 that are the exact trace of the cross-guard, and one with just each of the cross-guard. Glue the pieces together and clamp. Before you commit to clamping and letting the glue set, insert the blade into the hole to make sure it fits like you want it. Make any finishing touches.</p>

        <section class="content">
            <img src="images/handle.jpg" alt="emblem" class="img-left">
            <div class="text">
                <h4>The Handle</h4>
                <p>The handle is probably the most difficult part. Similar to the cross-guard, you will begin with 3 boards. Like before, choose one board to be the center of the handle, and make sure it is the same thickness as the blade tang. Trace the blade tang onto this piece, and cut out the trace. Next, glue all 3 board together. It's best to leave a few inches of material to cut off at the ends, once turning is complete.</p>
                <p>Now you will use your lathe, or begin the arduous task of carving it out by hand. Make sure not to take off too much material in this process, as the tang may crack the handle once it's inserted. This is where you can truly be creative, especially when carving. Make intricate designs of your own, or take inspiration from real swords. Once you finish, cut the ends off.</p>

        <section>
            <h4 style="text-align:center;">Assembly</h4>
            <p>Once you finish all the pieces, it's time to assemble. It should be self-explanatory enough, but one thing to remember is to not use too much glue for the cross-guard. You don't want the hassle of removing and sanding excess glue. Put the cross-guard on the blade, and then insert the tang into the handle. If you need, adjust the size of the tang to fit snugly into the handle, and then glue. Be sure before you start this step to make any decorative carving or adjustments to any of the pieces. Once it's assembled, it will likely be more difficult.</p>

                <h4>Finishing</h4>
                <p>Sanding can be done throughout the process, or at the end. Start with lower grit sand-paper, and work your way to a finer paper. Next, decide whether you want to stain or not. If you do, make sure to use pre-stain if you used a softer wood to avoid a splotchy application, then stain. Lastly, select a finish such as polyurethane or other wax or protective coating.</p>
