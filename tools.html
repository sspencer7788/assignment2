	<h1>Tools</h1>
	<p>The ease of any project can be determined by the tools you have available, and skill in which you use those tools. In theory, this entire project could be done with a solid piece of wood and hand-tools, however no small amount of skill would be required (which I don't have). However, if you have some of these tools at your disposal, then the project will be much faster, as well as reduce the amount of skill required to make each piece. But as with any equipment, make sure you know how to use them properly.

		<h4>Table Saw</h4>
		<p>A table saw will save you tons of time in the making of a sword. Here you can cut down the bulk pieces to the right sizes before using other tools. Additionally, you can use it to size down the thickness of the boards, since most likely the boards you buy are going to be a little to thick for a sword. SAFETY: Rememeber on a table saw the blade spins toward the user. This means that if pieces get bound up between the blade and the guard, they can be flung back at high speeds. Make sure you read the manual for your saw, wear safety glasses, DON'T wear gloves (if they material touches the blade, it could pull your hand into the blade), and be aware of your body parts near the blade.

		<h4>Planer</h4>
		<p>A planer will allow you to make sure your boards are straight, and change the thickness of the boards. You can get around for this project without one, but it is an important piece of equipment if you want more accurate project building. The planer has a rotating section of blades, but it is contained in the unit. For safe operation, read the manual, use eye protection, and due to the nature of planers, wear some sort of dust mask to prevent inhalation hazards. And obviously, don't stick your hand in the machine.

	<div class="text">
		<h4>Band Saw</h4>
	<p>This tool will allow you to cut thicker pieces of wood with more detail. This is how the shape of each piece will be cut. Alternatively, you could use a jigsaw, but it will be much more difficult to keep the cut straight. As with many of the power tools involved, wear eye protection, and do not wear gloves.

	<div class="text">
		<h4>Router and Router Table</h4>
		<p>This tool is more used to create the detail and depth to the piece. Making the blade angle for example will be a sinch with this tool. Just run the blade along the router bit. You can also play with different bits to see if other parts can be given some decoration. You have to be careful with this tool, as it requires some force from you to keep the piece stable as the bit does its work. Therefor you must be very cognicent of where your digits are when using this machine. It can cause injury quickly if you aren't paying close attention. eye protection is a must, and like with the planer, some sort of dust mask is advisable.

	<div class="text">
		<h4>Lathe</h4>
		<p> Used to spin wood very quickly, so you can use wood turning chisels to shape the wood. Used in the case for the handle. While the handle can certainly be hand carved, a lathe will speed of the process by a ton. However, this speed does come at a cost. Lathes are expensive, but what makes them expensive is the cost compared to the use cases. A band saw can be expensive, but a bandsaw will be quite useful for many projects. Lathes just simply don't have as many use cases as the other tools in this list. They are also one of the more dangerous pieces of equipment. Since the wood is turned very fast, the possibility of wood flying off at high speed is high. Care should be taken when using a lathe. Wear eye protection, be ready to turn the lathe off quickly if needed, and be sure to not attempt to take too much material off at once. Done correctly, it can be a very fun and rewarding tool to use and master.
